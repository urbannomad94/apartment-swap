# Traveling Teachers Network

Traveling Teachers Network is a platform that allows international school teachers to connect and organize house swaps during the holiday seasons.

I was inspired to create this website from my experience as an international school teacher. There are several times of year (October break, Winter break, Spring break, Summer break, etc.) where teachers all of the World are looking to travel and will often reach out to their network of other international school teachers to find someone who has an empty house/apartment they can stay in. This process can often be frustrating and awkward, but TTN solves that!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap

I utilized the MVC architecture in developing this platform. NodeJS with Express was used to create the backend. I used EJS as my templating language for now (I plan on updating my 'Views' using React in the future) and used the Bootstrap library to style the website. The database I used was MongoDB with the help of Mongoose to create schemas for the various collections.

## Optimizations

There are several features I plan to incorporate into the website in the future. These include:
*Adding a filter to the feed so users can be selective about the postings they see
*Including more amenities for the host to list about their posting (e.g. parking, A/C, washing machine, gated yard, streaming services, etc.)
*Changing the country text input to a pre-filled drop-down list
*Allow users to post multiple photos of their house/apartment
\*Using JSX (React) instead of EJS for the views
\*Monetize the website by making it a subscription service once the user base grows

## Lessons Learned:

Creating the TTN platform has taught me A LOT and helped to hone my skills as a web developer. It was my first time implementing MVC architecture into one of my projects and allowed me to gain a much deeper understanding of how the three elements interact. This was also my introduction to the Mongoose library. I found the ability to define schemas using Mongoose made designing the back-end so much easier and I look forward to diving deeper into all the tools Mongoose has to offer.
